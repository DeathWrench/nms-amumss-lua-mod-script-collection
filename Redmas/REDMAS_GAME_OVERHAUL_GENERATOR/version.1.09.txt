How to update ?

version 1.08 to version 1.09
--> replace everything.

version 1.09 +
--> replace everything, this will not erase your changes ( but features will be updated, and your "features.lua" will be back up)


Advices:

- You will need RGOG ( REDMAS GAME OVERHAUL GENERATOR ) to EDIT, MERGE, or UPDATE any "___Redmas_" MODS 
( use the lua coming from RGOG , not the one in the standalone mods )

-You should always have 1 "REDMAS" pak in the mods folder.

- Constructs : if you dont have have downloaded Constructs ,
https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/323 ( only the "core" .pak is needed ),
make sure to turn ["CONSTRUCTS_BY_MSSP_SPAWNER"] = "OFF",

- If you want to mix several of my mods, use the  "CUSTOM MOD"

- If you want to merge my mods with another mod(s), place the other mod(s) 
inside "_Engine\AMUMSS\ModScript" before running the "build mod"

- tips : 
in order to gain time ,
use AMUMSS in "Lean" mode for generating the full overhaul ( estimated time 10 minutes in "Lean" mode) 


Install :
-- do it once--
- EDIT "STEP_1_ENTER_NMS_FOLDER_HERE_BEFORE_INSTALL" with your own NMS folder location.
- RUN "STEP_2_INSTALL_Redmas_Game_Overhaul_Generator.bat"
- Go to "Mods Generation"
