Advices:

- use the .lua file with the "Redmas Game Overhaul Generator", because it requires the RGOG folder ( contening the EXML, XML, IMAGES, sub-folders)
- If you decide to use AMUMSS only anyway, add the RGOG folder ( contening the EXML, XML, IMAGES, sub-folders),  2 folders above "ModScript" ( ../../RGOG/ )

- You will need RGOG ( REDMAS GAME OVERHAUL GENERATOR ) to EDIT, MERGE, or UPDATE any "___Redmas_" MODS 
( use the lua coming from RGOG , not the one in the standalone mods )

- choose a PRESET, keep it, and edit it.
 
-You should always have 1 "REDMAS" pak in the mods folder. (if you mix several of the generated .pak you wil have conflicts. )

- Constructs : if you dont have have downloaded Constructs ,
https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/323 ( only the "core" .pak is needed ),
make sure to turn ["CONSTRUCTS_BY_MSSP_SPAWNER"] = "OFF",

- If you want to mix several of my mods, set INIT var to "CUSTOM_PRESET", and edit the "CUSTOM_PRESET"

- If you want to merge my mods with another mod(s), place the other mod(s) in "ModScript" folder,
 inside "Engine" before running the "build mod"

- tips : 
in order to gain time ,
use AMUMSS in "Lean" mode for generating the full overhaul ( estimated time 10 minutes in "Lean" mode) 


Install :
-- do it once--
- EDIT "STEP_1_ENTER_NMS_FOLDER_HERE_BEFORE_INSTALL" with your own NMS folder location.
- RUN "STEP_2_INSTALL_Redmas_Game_Overhaul_Generator.bat"
--------------
-- repeatable ---
option A :
- RUN "STEP_3_EDIT_REDMAS_MOD.bat", then
- RUN STEP_4_GENERATE_REDMAS_MOD.bat
option B ( will prevent modifying the default "REDMAS_MODS_BUILDER.lua" )
- EDIT "REDMAS_MODS_BUILDER.lua" located at ENGINE/ModScript
- RUN ENGINE/BuildMod.bat
