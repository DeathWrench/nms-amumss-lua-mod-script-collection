--[[ Summery Description:
significantly increases the analysis visors scan speed by nearly 3 times the speed.
It really doesn't do much else. It's a god send!
No longer will you be staring at a rock for 3-5 seconds to figure out that it indeed IS a rock...
Now it only takes 2-thirds of a second. HUGE improvement!
