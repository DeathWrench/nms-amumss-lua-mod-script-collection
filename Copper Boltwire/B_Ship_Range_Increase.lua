--[[ Summery Description:
While I have personally not noticed much of a change to this.
This mod is meant to change the distance at which you can interact with the ship... Like entering it.
Or maybe it's how far i can go from the ship before i can't interact with inventory of the ship cause on that note, i can go quite far.
So maybe that's what it does?
Yeah yeah yeah... I added a mod I wasn't fully aware of what does... Bite me!
