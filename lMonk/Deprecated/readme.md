The folders GLOBALS, META, MODELS, SHIPS, TABLES, TEXTURES & UI are my regular-use modifications - most of these scripts aren't developed around a specific idea like a distinct mod, but are an extensive collection of changes balanced to work together, and in a few places depend on each other. Much of my published mods are incorporated in them.<br>
Many of the changes and mods are my own, others were collected from -or inspired by others.<br>
The scripts have a short description of what they do, even if the name is not always descriptive.<br>
Enjoy :)
