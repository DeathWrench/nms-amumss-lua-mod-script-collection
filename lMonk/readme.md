Many of the changes and mods are my own, others were collected from -or inspired by others.<br>
GLOBALS, META, MODELS, SHIPS, TABLES, TEXTURES & UI folders are my regular-use modifications and most of my published mods are included in them; These scripts aren't separate & distinct mods, but more of an extensive collection of changes balanced ot work together, and in a few places depend on each other.<br>
All scripts have a short description of what they do, even if the name is not always descriptive.<br>
Enjoy :)
