### alchemist mods

- `modder_resource` - Useless as is, will need to customize to your own needs. Feel free to use in your own published mods (credit appreciated) but if you make changes to the core implementation be sure to share with the community so that the improvements eventually make it back here.
- `published` - I have published versions of these on the Nexus and will keeping them up to date best I can. Each presents the ability to customize to your own game.
- `unpublished` - Mostly globals, but a few things I just never got around to publishing. Probably a bunch of overlap with other authors, just with slightly tweaked values for my own balance.

A number of my more unique projects are Nexus exclusives for the purpose of support and gauging interest, but their source is still available. Visit my [Nexus Profile](https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/users/18079484?tab=user+files) for the full list.
