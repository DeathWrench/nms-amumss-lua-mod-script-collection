• You can add tweak names and their value here instead of altering the Lua files directly
• Any tweak values added here will overwrite the values found in the Lua files
• You need to set an option to 'false' to disable it; adding '--' to disable will not work from here
• Tweak names need to match the names in Lua files, they are case sensitive. Below are examples:

booleanSetting = true,				Enables 'booleanSetting'
numericValueSetting = 2,			Sets 'numericValueSetting' to '2'
stringValueSetting = "ENGLISH",		Sets 'stringValueSetting' to 'ENGLISH'

booleanSetting = false,				Disables 'booleanSetting'
numericValueSetting = false,		Disables 'numericValueSetting'
stringValueSetting = false,			Disables 'stringValueSetting'

--exampleSetting = true,			This will NOT disable 'exampleSetting'
numericValueSetting = true,			This will most likely cause an error; value types needs to match
someOtherSetting = false,			-- You can have comments and copy/paste the option line here as a whole

• Purpose of this file is to provide a way to back your settings up & make them unaffected through updates
• All tweaks except 'lyr_entityIcons' may use this file, as long as it is placed in the 'ModScripts\ModHelperScripts' folder
• You can delete this help part, EXCEPT the line below or otherwise this file will do nothing

--[[ DO NOT ALTER OR DELETE NEXT LINE // ADD YOUR OVERRIDES BELOW IT // PLACE THIS FILE IN 'MODSCRIPTS\MODHELPERSCRIPTS' FOLDER ]]--
